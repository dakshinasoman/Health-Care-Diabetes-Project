# Health-Care-Diabetes-Project
The aim of this project is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not.

Dataset Description
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and outcome.

Variables Description
• Pregnancies Number of times pregnant
• Glucose Plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test
• BloodPressure Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
• SkinThickness Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
• Insulin Two hour serum insulin
• BMI Body Mass Index
• DiabetesPedigreeFunction Diabetes pedigree function
• Age Age in years
• Outcome Class variable (either 0 or 1). 268 of 768 values are 1, and the others are 0

Project Task: Week 1: Descriptive analysis
• Perform descriptive analysis. Understand the variables and their corresponding values. On the columns below, a value of zero does not make sense and thus indicates missing value:
o Glucose
o BloodPressure
o SkinThickness
o Insulin
o BMI
• Visually explore these variables using histograms. Treat the missing values accordingly.
• There are integer and float data type variables in this dataset. Create a count (frequency) plot describing the data types and the count of variables.

Project Task: Week 2: EDA
• Check the balance of the data by plotting the count of outcomes by their value. Describe your findings and plan future course of action.
• Create scatter charts between the pair of variables to understand the relationships. Describe your findings.
• Perform correlation analysis. Visually explore it using a heat map.

Project Task: Week 3: Predictive analytics
• Devise strategies for model building. It is important to decide the right validation framework. Express your thought process.
• Apply an appropriate classification algorithm to build a model. Compare various models with the results from KNN algorithm.
